This is a HTML5 Boilerplate Starter kit for Drupal 7

After several theming projects where I had to overwrite tons and tons of theming functions in order to
implement the desired HTML front end code, I decided to create a starter kit with the purpose to reduce
the time it takes to get starter on new theming projects.

Building a Drupal theme based on existing HTML markup should be easier - the soal purpose of this project
is exactly that! Reduce the time it takes to get started.
