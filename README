This is a HTML5 Boilerplate Starter kit for Drupal 7

After several theming projects where I had to overwrite tons and tons of theming functions in order to implement the desired HTML front end code, I decided to create a starter kit with the purpose to reduce the time it takes to get starter on new theming projects.

Building a Drupal theme based on existing HTML markup should be easier - the soal purpose of this project is exactly that! Reduce the time it takes to get started.

Getting started
CD into your themes directory >>cd sites/all/themes<< and clone this project into the disired theme project >>git clone git@github.com:kristiannissen/drupal7html5boilerplatestarterkit.git bluepoc<< where bluepoc is the name of my custom theme.

Open template.php using your favorite editor and replace "starterkit" with the name of your custom theme name.

That's it, now your ready to build your website :)
